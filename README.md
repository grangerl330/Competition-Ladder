## About

This is the React frontend for the Competition Ladder App, an app designed for users to build and edit ladders to be used for ladder competition

Ladder competition is a that format sees all competing players placed in a ladder, one on top of the other. Players challenge each other. If a player lower down the ladder beats a higher placed player, they change places – the lower, winning player moving up the ladder.

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

## Running the App

**Please fork and clone this repo then run:**

`npm install`

**To start the frontend server on your local machine, run:**

`npm start`

Shut down the server by pressing ctrl + C

This will run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

*This will only start up the frontend server of the app. In order for the app to function, you must fork and clone the API portion of the app and follow the README instructions to start the backend server. This can be found at:*

## Available Scripts

*All information in this section was automatically generated by* `create-react-app`

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
